\title{MCMC_inferCNV class}
\description{
Uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Gibbs sampling to estimate the posterior
probability of being in one of six Copy Number Variation states (states: 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3) for CNV's identified by
inferCNV's HMM. Posterior probabilities are found for the entire CNV cluster and each individual
cell line in the CNV.
